Code 2040 Challenge 

The hardest part of the challenge was to get used to naturally using JSOn. Although I had previously worked with JSOn during a JavaScript course that I had taken 
previously I was not very comfortable with it.

Using PHP to handle JSOn requests and responses proved to be a more reliable solution for me. The rest of the challenge went smoothly after that.
